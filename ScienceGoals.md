## What do I need to show in this paper?

- Make sure I am getting accurate axial spectra, not missing a low-lying narrow peak
- Update code so that it loads existing data for the spectrum at given parameter values, avoiding duplicate calculations
- Demonstrate the existence of a first-order transition for axial meson spectra
- Determine the values of $m_q$ and $\lambda_1$ associated with a critical point, as evidenced by meson spectra
- Assess the effect of $\gamma$ and $\lambda_4$ parameter choices on meson spectra and phase structure
- Identify parameter choices that match meson spectra at zero temperature
- Assess whether this setup yields both a critical point and a reasonable melting temperature
- Compare with a recent paper I reviewed that found crossover behavior for meson spectra even when the Hawking (deconfinement) transition is first-order
- Use axial and vector meson spectra to look for signs of chiral symmetry restoration via axial/vector degeneracy below melting temperatures
- Investigate whether axial/vector degeneracy occurs for parameter sets that also produce a critical point
- Determine whether a first-order chiral restoration can be evidenced directly in meson spectra
